# Local AI Agents

This directory is intended to house the implementation of AI agents that can run locally without requiring an internet connection.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these agents is to provide core functionalities of the system even when operating in an offline environment. This is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted service and data processing capabilities.

## Proposed Structure

The agents in this directory will be designed to work with local AI models, such as those from the DeepSeek family or other GGUF/ONNX compatible models.

A potential structure could include:
- `base_local_agent.py`: A base class for local agents, handling model loading and inference.
- `document_processing_agent.py`: An agent specialized in processing and summarizing documents locally.
- `query_agent.py`: An agent capable of answering questions based on a local knowledge base.

This structure will be developed further based on specific offline requirements.
